When you move tokens between blockchains the token is \"Dematerialized\" or burned on the originating blockchain and is then \"Energized\" or minted on the destination blockchain. Our bridge like all our other offerings are available on our Mobile App as well as our Dapp but things are much more of a seamless experience from our app so we highly reccomend it. NFA The purpose of this part of the guide is to guide you through the teleportation process on both platforms. How to Teleport using the Fundamenta Mobile App This section is about using our bridge via our easy to use mobile application. It is MUCH simpler of a process than with the Dapp and we reccomend newer users take advatage of this. To use the bridge via the app with a compatible token all you need to to is select it from your balance screen. Make sure you select the network you want to teleport from. If the token is CiviPort compatible the option TELEPORT will be available for selection along with TRANSFER and SWAP . I think you can guess what is next but just in case you don't we will show you. Initiating a teleport Now that you are where you need to be to initiate a teleport you are only a few short steps away from being a multi-chain master. First you need to select the network you wish to teleport your coins too. Click where you see Select Network and a modal will appear where you can choose one of our 7 supported networks. After selecting the destination you just need to enter the amount you wish to teleport. Click Teleport and watch the magic happen! Energizing a teleport With Fundamenta Mobile you have the option of energizing teleports yourself or having the app attempt to do that for you automatically. You can configure this in the settings section available by clicking the gear icon in the top right corner. In either case the end result is the same. That being said... For the sake of this tutorial we will operate with automatic teleport energizing off. The only difference? You need to click something. Yup thats it. Now to buissness. Once the teleport has been initiated and the first part of the transaction is complete we need to navigate to the teleports screen. You can do this by clicking the second icon from the right on the bottom navbar. Once there you will see your teleport at the top of the list (if its not your first one) with the status Queued . All you need to do to energize the teleport on the destination is click it. Once clicked it will contact the validator swarm. There is a minimum amount of blocks that need to be created before a teleport can be imitiated. If there is still some time remaining the app will let you know. In this case we just need to wait. Once the app contacts the swarm again and is able to achieve concensus with the other swarm nodes our all so familiar gas and transaction confirmation prompt will appear and ask if you want to energize. Select yes and we are of to the races. Switch to the transaction history page which is the icon directly to the left of the teleport one you are currently on to watch it finish. Once complete you have successfully traversed blockchains and can freely use those tokens as you please. And just becasue we all like to watch things here it is all in action. And thats it! Within a few clicks you can traverse chains with ease all from the comfort of the toilet or... you know wherever you use your mobile device the most. How to teleport FMTA using the Dapp Connect First we need to make sure we are connected to the dapp with our wallet by clicking the connect button in the top right of the interface. If on Desktop you will be given the choice to use Metamask's browser extension or Wallet Connect to connect. Select Token and Network Next we need to select the token we wish to teleport and the network we wish to energize it on. Time to teleport Once the token and network have ben selected enter the amount you wish to move across chains and click teleport! Once you have done this if using Metamask a confirmation will pop up asking to confirm the teleport. Once confirmed and the transaction has processed the Dapp should automatically prompt you to switch networks to the destination blockchain. After switching networks the Dapp should automatically prompt you with another Metamask confirmation to allow the tokens to be energized on the destination blockchain. In some cases some more confirmations may be required before the tokens can be energized. In this case you will see a warning telling you how many more blocks there are to go before the teleport can be energized. After the required blocks have passed the dapp should automatically prompt you to energize and accept the transaction. If all is well you will see an alert telling you it has been successful. Troubleshooting with the Teleports Multichain programs are fun but as fun as they are they are also complicated due to having to communicate with mutliple networks in a secure and useful fashion. Ideally your teleports with the Dapp will always automagically prompt you where it needs to while using CiviPort but there may be a reson this is not the case. Wheter it be network connectivity, a wrongly clicked button or just bad luck you my need to manually energize a teleport once in a while. Not to worry though because this is very easily done! Energizing Manually There is an app (or option at least) for that! You may have noticed on the Bridge page that there are two options. Teleport and Energize. We have already gone over what Teleport does and is used for and as you have guessed, Energize will help you energize your teleport if for some reason you ever have to manually. The first thing you need to do is obtain the transaction hash or \"TXID\" of the transaction on the blockchain that the teleport was initiated on. Refer to your wallets history to find this as it should be the very last transaction you sent. NOTE: Make sure you are connected the originating network with your wallet as this is required. Once you have the TXID you simply just need to plug that into the energize tab and click \"energize\"! Once this is complete the network switch prompt (like shown above) will pop up and ask you to switch to the destination network and then the comfirmation for the pending teleport will appear. Confrim and your teleport is complete. Of course if you need any further assitance please feel free to come ask for help in either our Telegram or Discord communities where someone is always around to help.","title":"Bridge"},{"location":"Bridging/#teleport-tokens-between-blockchains-using-civitas-fundamentas-bridge-civiport","text":"Using our bridge users can Move FMTA and others from one blockchain to another.

It is designed from the ground up with multi-chain users as its focus. It currently supports 7 networks and the best part is you can se and manage all these assets without any network configurations! Let's get started its super easy! Opening the application for the first time Upon the first time you open the application you will be presented with a Terms of Service screen. Nobody likes terms and conditions but this is something that can't be avoided. We collect absolutely zero data so there is no data mining. Please read the terms and then hit the accept button to continue. Pin setup This part is pretty self explanitory but we will explain it anyways. Now you must create 6 digit Pin before creation or restoration of a wallet. Enter it once and then enter it again for confirmation. Options to create a wallet After choosing a pin you will then be brought to the \"Create a wallet\" Screen. You will be given three choices. NEW WALLET , IMPORT SEED/PRIVATE KEY or SCAN A CIVIPORT WALLET QR New Wallet This is absolutely the simplest way to get started and create a new wallet. See the example below of just how easy! After accepting the terms and conditions nd creating a pin if you do not require importing an old wallet all you need to do is click NEW WALLET . It will then take you to another disclaimer that you must accept (WE CANNOT HELP YOU KEEP YOUR WALLET SAFE FROM USER ERROR) and you will then have your fancy new multi-chain Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible wallet ready to explore! Note that wallets created this way use the MetaMask seed schema. Import Seed or Private Key When choosing the Seed or Private Key option you will be be brought to an input and selection screen. This is where you will need to select either the PRIVATE KEY or SEED PHRASE option. Please note that Fundamenta Mobile is compatible with MetaMask seed phrases making switching over simple and easy. Seed Phrases consist of 12 words and look something like Juice Tanker Yellow Garage Auto Ready Great Restore Unless Treaty Indigo Wheat Private Keys will consist of of 64 Bit Random Hex and look something like 652a97845864a14281e6a28baa6b993fb3c81db6dd3b51303caaf2ebce3d39b6 Once you have made your choice and entered your seed phrase or private key you will arrive on our final disclaimer. This one also lets you know that it is you and not Civitas Fundamenta who is resposnsible for proper backup and storage of your seed phrase or private key. Scan a CiviPort Wallet QR Fundamenta Mobile also has the ability to both export and import QR Codes that can be generated in the app. We will go into detail on how to backup your seed phrase or private keys in a later section. Restoring with a QR is real easy. All you need to do is select SCAN A CIVIPORT WALLET QR and accept the permission to allow the app to use your camera. It will recognize the QR code and load the required info. If you were smart and used QR encryption you must enter your encryption key before continuing to decrypt your QR. Once decrypted you will be brought to our backup disclaimer screen. Give your wallet a name, select the slider to acknowledge the discliamer and you are all done! Backing up your wallets The first thing you should do after creating a new wallet is back it up. It cannot be stressed enough that without your recovery phrase, private keys or backup QR code you cannot restore your wallets funds in the case of a lost device or data loss/corruption. This is the only way to ensure continued accesss to your funds. SECURITY NOTE: It is imperitive that you take the security and storage of your seed phrase/private keys seriously. Aside from the fact that if they are misplaced or dmamged you could lose access to your funds, there is also the possibility of an attacker obtaining your seed phrase/private keys and if stored unencrypted you could be at a total loss. Backup Procedure Wallet management in Fundamenta Mobile happens all in one place. To get to the account management screen go ahead and click the Blockie or address on the top of the applications screen shown below. Once you have entered the Accounts management screen you will be presented with two types of address schema that Fundamenta Mobile supports. Seed Generated or Imported . Now remember if you chose to create a new wallet with the app and not import one your address will be seed generated. Likewise if you were to import a seed from MetaMask it would also be located under the seed generated option. If you were to import a private key only (which are avaialbe for every ethereum address in existence) it would appear under the Imported option. It is the same procedure for either option to backup. On the account managment screen simply choose the double arrow down in any of the areas to reveal either the wallets seed phrase or accounts exports page. There are a few ways this can be accomplished now. You can chose to reveal the seed phrase or private key and long click it to copy it to the clipboard This is generally considered insecure Once copied to the clipboard the seed phrase or private key can be stored any way the user chooses. You can use the integrated QR Export too to create an encrypted QR Code of either your seed phrase or chosen private key. This can then be exported by any of the apps on ypur phone or even printed like a paper wallet. NOTE: If encrypting your QR code make sure you can remember or have a backup of your password because without it you WILL lose access to your funds. Both of these methods are shown below Important Note Seed Generated addressess and all those created after are what is called deterministic . The long and the skinny of this is the first address is derived from the seed as is each address after. This means if you are using the seed genrated wallet option you could create 12 addresses, delete the apps data, restore the wallet with the seed phrase and continue to create another 12 addresses you will find that will all be the same as before. This is an obvious advantage to using the seed system because it allows you to have a single phrase for back up for an almost infiite amount of wallet/private key pairs.

The current system allows for a blanket and unchanging APY of 73%. The formula to calculate your daily rewards is quite simple and is currently set at Tokens Staked / 500 = Daily Reward . Currently single accounts have a cap of how much they can stake. This makes daily staking emissions predictable. Fundamenta staking is available on every single chain we support at the same APY. Just buy or teleport Fundamenta to the network of your choice and use the Dapp or Mobile app to get staking. A FEW WARNINGS Fundamenta's staking contracts accross networks have a few quirks that you need to be aware of to maximize rewards and make sure you are not locked into a position when you do not want to be. First and foremost Fundamenta staking has a mandatory 48 Hour Lock Period. The period activates as soon as you place a position. 48 Hours re determined by the amount of blocks that are supposed to approximately be created in a single day. For example on Ethereum 6500 Blocks would represent approx 24 Hours. Because each network has different block time targets this number is different between blockchains. This also means that it is just an approximation of time and not an exact calculation. There will be times where your position or rewards unlock slightly before or slightly after the advertised lock period in hours/minutes. While there is a 48 HR lock after you stake before you can remove your position, your rewards will begin to accrue and be available to withdraw within 24 hrs. It is possible to TAKE or COMPOUND your daily rewards every 24 hours but take note that by doing so the 48 hour stake removal lock will be reset. If you would like for your position to be continuously unlocked yet still accrue rewards this is possible by not taking or compunding pending rewards. All pending rewards will be automatically withdrawn when your position is removed. It is not required for you to take or compound before you wish to partially or completely remove your position. IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE STAKE AND TAKE OR COMPUND FIRST YOU WILL NEED TO WAIT ANOTHER 48 HOURS Using the Mobile App to stake As is a current theme with our products it is by far the easiest to create and manage a staking position from our mobile application. Within a few clicks you can be earning 73% APY Daily on your Fundamenta Tokens. To get where you need to be in the app so you get started click the second icon from the left (vault). NOTE: This guide asumes you are already holding Fundamenta Once you arrive on the staking screen choose your desired network and click the card. it will take you to the Fundamenta Staking screen for your selected network. Here you will be presented with 4 tab selection options TAKE , COMPOUND , ADD and REMOVE . Hopefully these are self explanitory but we will give a brief explanation for each. TAKE will allow you to withdraw any pending rewards you currently have to your acount COMPOUND will all you to roll any pending rewards into your current staking position as long as the account is still under the stake cap per account limit. ADD will allow you to add more Fundamenta to your current staking position. NOTE: you will not be able to add to your position if you have pending rewards. You must take or compund them first. REMOVE will allow you to partially or completely remove your staked position. Unlike ADD you do not need to TAKE or COMPOUND any pending rewards as these are automatucally withdrawn with your stake. NOTE: IF YOU TAKE OR COMPOUND REWARDS YOUR STAKE LOCK PERIOD IS RESET TO 48 HOURS AND YOU WILL NEED TO WAIT BEFORE YOU CAN REMOVE YOUR STAKED FUNDAMENTA. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!! Adding a new position If you are a new staker choose the ADD select the amount of Fundamenta you want to stake and complete creating a position by clicking add below. A prompt will appear asking you which gas level you would like to use (Slow, Average, Fast). It will have some information about the fees and give you the option to accept or decline the transaction. Make sure to check back every day so see your rewards grow every 24 hours. If you compound daily your position will grow faster. YAY Math! Compounding Fees Suck . This is the reality and no one likes paying them. They most definitely do not enjoy having to pay them twice which is what users would have to do if there was not a way to compound your pending rewards. In fact V1 of our staking contract did not have a compund function and that was the actual reality. Thankfully we upgraded shortly after launch to staking V2 with this fancy new compounding ability. Everyday you will have the ability to compund your pending rewards and because your daily rewards are based on the amount of Fundamenta staked compunding everyday will yield more and more every time you do. You can compound pending rewards at any time in any amount so long as the amount will not bring your staked position over the configured cap per account currently and 120,000 FMTA. The process of compunding is quite simple. Navigate to the Staking screen for the network of your choice, select the COMPOUND Tab and click the following button. The gas selection and transaction confirmation prompt will appear. Select yes and wait for the transaction to comoplete. Once complete if you do not see your pending rewards now as part of your staked position slide the screen down to trigger a refresh and you should now show the new staked balance. Adding to an existing position So you want to add more Fundamenta to your staked position to get even more of those sweet sweet rewards. Good Choice! Well good news you already know how to do this! Just navigate to the add Tab on the staking screen of the network of your choice and do thew same thing you did while adding the original position. Just make sure you DO NOT have any pending rewards because adding to an existing position while a user has pending rewards is not possible. If you do have pending rewards simply TAKE or COMPOUND them and once complete you can freely add to your position so long as it does not bring the account over the stake cap per account. Removing all or part of your staked position So it's time to unstake and do something. No Problem! So long as you haven't compounded or taken any pending rewards in the last 48 hours that is. When placing a new position a lock is activated that lasts approximately 48 hours. That lock is deactivated after 48 hours and users can remove any amount from their position at will HOWEVER every time you decide to take or compound any pending rewards this stake lock is REACTIVATED . You will then need to wait for the lock to deactivate before you can remove any of your staked position. Ok great... but what if my position is unlocked and I do have pending rewards? (Spoiler Alert: You Will) Simply remove the amount you wish and all pending rewards will be removed with them. As always on mobile this process is a snap. Navigate to the staking page of the network of your choice, select REMOVE and enter the amount you wish to remove. Select the remove button below and wait for the transaction to complete. You have now removed part or all of your position and any pending rewards if there were any. NOTE: If you only remove part of your position your stake lock period is reset to 48 hours. Using the Dapp online to stake Disclaimer While we REALLY REALLY REALLY want you to use our mobile app for all things Web3 we understand some users just don't do crypto on mobile. There is also the idea users just like the convenience of both offerings. So in that spirit we will go over how to stake the Fundamenta Token using the Dapp online. First things first DON'T GET PHISHED!!!

Always ensure you are coneccted to our offical url at https://app.fundamenta.network before connecting or doing anything. The following tutorial assumes user will be using the MetaMask desktop extension Navigate to the staking page Page navigation for the app is located floating on the bottom. Select Stake from the Navbar to arrive on the staking page. Placing a new position Adding a new position or to an existing one is relatively easy. As we can see in the above example of the staking page there is an input box that shows our current Fundamenta balance and a max button. Enter the amount you wish or opt to choose the max button. Once the amount is entered you will be able to click the Stake button and place a new position. NOTE: There is a cap to the amount of tokens a single account can stake. Currently this set at 120,000 FMTA. Once you click the stake button the all so familiar MetaMask confirmation modal will appear asking you to complete the contract interaction. Choose yes and once its complete you will have placed a staking position. Congratulations! Compounding pending rewards Compounding is absolutely the best thing to do if your goal is to grow your stake as much as possible. Rewards accrue for your position every 24 hours and you will have access to either TAKE or COMPOUND those rewards at any time you like. Seeing as how these daily rewards are based on your staked balance everytime you compound or add to an existing position making the amount staked rise as will your daily rewards. To do this we navigate to staking page of the Dapp. Of course make sure you are connected to the proper network. Once there you will find the TAKE and COMPOUND options on the top right of the staking card on screen. Taking Pending Rewards Adding stake to an existing position Adding to an existing position is possible as well. The process is exactly the same as placing a new position with one caveat. Users cannot have any pending rewards. If a user wants to add to a position and has pending rewards they must TAKE or COMPOUND those rewards first. Once that is completed users are free to add to thier position so long as it does not bring the account over the configured stake cap per account.","title":"Stake"},{"location":"Staking/#staking-the-fundamenta-token","text":"Users who hold the Fundamenta token have the ability to choose and stake their tokens to earn daily yield. The current system allows for a blanket and unchanging APY of 73%. The formula to calculate your daily rewards is quite simple and is currently set at Tokens Staked / 500 = Daily Reward . Currently single accounts have a cap of how much they can stake. This makes daily staking emissions predictable. Fundamenta staking is available on every single chain we support at the same APY. Just buy or teleport Fundamenta to the network of your choice and use the Dapp or Mobile app to get staking.","title":"Staking the Fundamenta Token"},{"location":"Staking/#a-few-warnings","text":"Fundamenta's staking contracts accross networks have a few quirks that you need to be aware of to maximize rewards and make sure you are not locked into a position when you do not want to be. First and foremost Fundamenta staking has a mandatory 48 Hour Lock Period. The period activates as soon as you place a position. 48 Hours re determined by the amount of blocks that are supposed to approximately be created in a single day. For example on Ethereum 6500 Blocks would represent approx 24 Hours. Because each network has different block time targets this number is different between blockchains. This also means that it is just an approximation of time and not an exact calculation. There will be times where your position or rewards unlock slightly before or slightly after the advertised lock period in hours/minutes. While there is a 48 HR lock after you stake before you can remove your position, your rewards will begin to accrue and be available to withdraw within 24 hrs. It is possible to TAKE or COMPOUND your daily rewards every 24 hours but take note that by doing so the 48 hour stake removal lock will be reset. If you would like for your position to be continuously unlocked yet still accrue rewards this is possible by not taking or compunding pending rewards. All pending rewards will be automatically withdrawn when your position is removed. It is not required for you to take or compound before you wish to partially or completely remove your position. IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE STAKE AND TAKE OR COMPUND FIRST YOU WILL NEED TO WAIT ANOTHER 48 HOURS","title":"A FEW WARNINGS"},{"location":"Staking/#using-the-mobile-app-to-stake","text":"As is a current theme with our products it is by far the easiest to create and manage a staking position from our mobile application. Within a few clicks you can be earning 73% APY Daily on your Fundamenta Tokens. To get where you need to be in the app so you get started click the second icon from the left (vault). NOTE: This guide asumes you are already holding Fundamenta Once you arrive on the staking screen choose your desired network and click the card. it will take you to the Fundamenta Staking screen for your selected network. Here you will be presented with 4 tab selection options TAKE , COMPOUND , ADD and REMOVE . Hopefully these are self explanitory but we will give a brief explanation for each. TAKE will allow you to withdraw any pending rewards you currently have to your acount COMPOUND will all you to roll any pending rewards into your current staking position as long as the account is still under the stake cap per account limit. ADD will allow you to add more Fundamenta to your current staking position. NOTE: you will not be able to add to your position if you have pending rewards. You must take or compund them first. REMOVE will allow you to partially or completely remove your staked position. Unlike ADD you do not need to TAKE or COMPOUND any pending rewards as these are automatucally withdrawn with your stake.

They most definitely do not enjoy having to pay them twice which is what users would have to do if there was not a way to compound your pending rewards. In fact V1 of our staking contract did not have a compund function and that was the actual reality. Thankfully we upgraded shortly after launch to staking V2 with this fancy new compounding ability. Everyday you will have the ability to compund your pending rewards and because your daily rewards are based on the amount of Fundamenta staked compunding everyday will yield more and more every time you do. You can compound pending rewards at any time in any amount so long as the amount will not bring your staked position over the configured cap per account currently and 120,000 FMTA. The process of compunding is quite simple. Navigate to the Staking screen for the network of your choice, select the COMPOUND Tab and click the following button. The gas selection and transaction confirmation prompt will appear. Select yes and wait for the transaction to comoplete.

Good Choice! Well good news you already know how to do this! Just navigate to the add Tab on the staking screen of the network of your choice and do thew same thing you did while adding the original position. Just make sure you DO NOT have any pending rewards because adding to an existing position while a user has pending rewards is not possible.

That lock is deactivated after 48 hours and users can remove any amount from their position at will HOWEVER every time you decide to take or compound any pending rewards this stake lock is REACTIVATED . You will then need to wait for the lock to deactivate before you can remove any of your staked position. Ok great... but what if my position is unlocked and I do have pending rewards? (Spoiler Alert: You Will) Simply remove the amount you wish and all pending rewards will be removed with them. As always on mobile this process is a snap.
