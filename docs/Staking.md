# Staking the Fundamenta Token

Users who hold the Fundamenta token have the ability to choose and stake their tokens to earn daily yield.  The current system allows for a blanket and unchanging APY of 73%.  The formula to calculate your daily rewards is quite simple and is currently set at `Tokens Staked / 500 = Daily Reward`.  Currently single accounts have a cap of how much they can stake.  This makes daily staking emissions predictable.  

Fundamenta staking is available on every single chain we support at the same APY.  Just buy or teleport Fundamenta to the network of your choice and use the Dapp or Mobile app to get staking.

# A FEW WARNINGS

Fundamenta's staking contracts accross networks have a few quirks that you need to be aware of to maximize rewards and make sure you are not locked into a position when you do not want to be.

First and foremost Fundamenta staking has a mandatory 48 Hour Lock Period.  The period activates as soon as you place a position.  48 Hours re determined by the amount of blocks that are supposed to approximately be created in a single day.  For example on Ethereum 6500 Blocks would represent approx 24 Hours.   Because each network has different block time targets this number is different between blockchains.  This also means that it is just an approximation of time and not an exact calculation.  There will be times where your position or rewards unlock slightly before or slightly after the advertised lock period in hours/minutes.

While there is a 48 HR lock after you stake before you can remove your position, your rewards will begin to accrue and be available to withdraw within 24 hrs.  It is possible to `TAKE` or `COMPOUND` your daily rewards every 24 hours but take note that by doing so the 48 hour stake removal lock will be reset.  If you would like for your position to be continuously unlocked yet still accrue rewards this is possible by not taking or compunding pending rewards.  All pending rewards will be automatically withdrawn when your position is removed.  It is not required for you to take or compound before you wish to partially or completely remove your position.  **IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE STAKE AND TAKE OR COMPUND FIRST YOU WILL NEED TO WAIT ANOTHER 48 HOURS**

## Using the Mobile App to stake

As is a current theme with our products it is by far the easiest to create and manage a staking position from our mobile application.  Within a few clicks you can be earning 73% APY Daily on your Fundamenta Tokens.  To get where you need to be in the app so you get started click the second icon from the left (vault). **NOTE: This guide asumes you are already holding Fundamenta**

Once you arrive on the staking screen choose your desired network and click the card. it will take you to the Fundamenta Staking screen for your selected network.  Here you will be presented with 4 selection options `TAKE`, `COMPOUND`, `ADD` and `REMOVE`.  Hopefully these are self explanitory but we will give a brief explanation for each.
* `TAKE` will allow you to withdraw any pending rewards you currently have to your acount
* `COMPOUND` will all you to roll any pending rewards into your current staking position as long as the account is still under the stake cap per account limit.
* `ADD` will allow you to add more Fundamenta to your current staking position. NOTE: you will not be able to add to your position if you have pending rewards.  You must take or compund them first.
